JAMB Exam Performance Analysis
Introduction
The JAMB Exam Performance Analysis explores key success factors influencing student outcomes in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). This study examines teacher quality, school type, and study habits, providing insights into how these factors impact student performance. The dataset consists of 5,000 students from both public and private schools, allowing for a comparative analysis of different educational environments.
Key Findings
1. Study Hours and Teacher Quality
•	High-Quality teachers had students with the highest average study hours per week (21.22 hours), followed by Medium-Quality teachers (20.18 hours), and Low-Quality teachers (18.55 hours).
•	This suggests a positive correlation between teacher effectiveness and student commitment to study.
2. Student Distribution by School Type
•	Public schools had a significantly higher student count (3,735 students) compared to private schools (1,265 students).
•	This highlights the larger enrollment sizes in public institutions, which could impact teacher-student ratios and resource allocation.
3. Performance Distribution
•	Below Average students in public schools made up 33.48% of the total student count.
•	The average number of students per school was higher for public schools (747 students) than private schools (253 students).
•	The largest divergence in student numbers was observed in the Below Average score group, where public schools had 1,209 more students than private schools.
Visualization and Insights
To make these findings more actionable, the analysis was visualized in Power BI using:
•	Card Visuals to display key metrics such as highest score, average score, total score, and student count.
•	Bar and Column Charts to compare performance across different score groups and school types.
•	Conditional Formatting to highlight performance trends using green (high), orange (medium), and red (low) categories.
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting student performance in JAMB. The findings suggest that teacher quality, study habits, and school type significantly influence results. Understanding these elements can help educators and policymakers improve student outcomes through better curriculum alignment, enhanced teacher training, and the strategic use of technology in learning.
